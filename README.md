# hello-world
Hello ! my name is Arnaud, I'm 37 and I'm learning to code !
I started with the basics of html and javascript wich I'm now planning to explore further.
I plan to also learn php basics to have a good idea on how the whole thing works, and after I've done all of that I'll see where I can go from there !
I'll start using github as soon as I'm able to put something together by myself
